Everyone who's played enough (or studied game theory) knows that Tic-Tac-Toe is broken.
As long as both players aren't stupid, the game will end in a draw.
I tried to explain that when you challenged me that night, but somehow against you I still felt kept on my Toes
Like you knew so much more than me
Or would stumble onto a Chessmaster-level move I knew mathematically couldn't exist
And each game we played I feared I was wrong, I'd be the fool
And I knew I would keep playing forever, if it was with you&mdash;

I guess I know now that you weren't playing the same game.
