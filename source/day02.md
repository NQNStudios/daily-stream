{{5/23/18: S2}}

My showers have been really nice lately and it [isn't]({#day2just:inline}) because of what we talked about last time.

{{Day2-1}}

{#day2LightsOut}

Well it is because of that. But it's also because [the lights are out.]({@Day2-2})

{{Day2-2: Dark, Sprite, shower}}

I turn on my phone's flashlight and then everything's bathed in this ghostly glow.

That's how it looks in my head. I make this game on a tight schedule [okay?]({@Day2-3})

{{Day2-3: Dark, Sprite, none}}

Anyway, partway through it, the flashlight turns off and then I can't see anything. It's like [floating]({@Day2-4}) in the hot water rain.

{{Day2-4: Dark, Sprite, none}}

The first time I did it, I couldn't find my soap in the dark and I'm pretty sure I used someone else's. I smelled like peppermint [after.]({@Day2-5})

{{Day2-5: Dark, Sprite, shower}}

Then I turn the flashlight on again and I can see the mist from the shower, just floating in the dark like I do.

I only wish the lights worked when I go to pee...

[See you tomorrow.]({@Menu})
