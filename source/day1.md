I'm back in New York City! This is the place where I first decided to start making Stream of Pretentiousness. Let me set the tone of [TODO the game/my life] by telling you an [anecdote]({@Day1-Anecdote}) about moving here.

{{Day1-Anecdote}}

I'm only here for the next 3 months, and on a tight budget. This is where I sleep: 

(TODO show apartment)

It's a shared bedroom with a total of 6 beds. I don't get much alone time.
