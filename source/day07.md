{{Day7Backstory}}

For about three weeks, I was a writer for [Her Campus Utah.](http://www.hercampus.com/author/nat-quayle-nelson)

You are about to read my third article, which was deemed extremely hilarious but too vulgar to be published.

That's not why I quit&mdash;I quit because the site is run by a for-profit company that doesn't pay its writers anything. It seems really unfair and anti-feminist that the women who set out to empower women in college, would see fit to profit off of unpaid labor by women.

Without further ado... [Valentines from a Tinder Daddy]({@Day7TinderDaddy})
