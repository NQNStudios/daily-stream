I might have [overreacted]({@Day11Overreacted}) yesterday.

I know there's not much of an audience for what I'm doing here, but of the people who *do* read, I wonder if anyone else really understands [why]({@Day11Why}) I get so emotional about what engine I'm using to make Stream of Pretentiousness.

{{Day11Why}}

This game represents a lot to me. It's actually more of a test bed for the game I've been [working on](https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=61162.msg1336557#msg1336557) for the last year and a half. My plan was to do Stream of Pretentiousness for a month in SpaceFractive, the engine I was planning to use for my magnum opus, so I could spot all the engine's weaknesses and build it into the tool I need.

So when I thought it wasn't going to work anymore, [I freaked out.]({@Day11FreakedOut})

I tried to learn [Ink](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) in a morning and I actually used it to make yesterday's episode (still within SpaceFractive). This was a really good thing to do&mdash;now I know if things really don't work out with Fractive, I have other options. But I don't have to quit on Fractive altogether! I still love this engine and I've got more fun left to have with it.
