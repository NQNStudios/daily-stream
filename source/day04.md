Fuck, these streets are [so lonely.]({@Day4-2})

{{Day4-2: Dark, Sprite, cards, Scale, 0.1}}

Getting off the subway I saw a deck of cards someone had [ripped to shreds]({@Day4-3}) and scattered everywhere.

{{Day4-3: Dark, Sprite, goodhand, Scale, 0.1}}

And I realized I've been dealt a really good hand with this summer in New York, but that's what sucks:

No amount of loneliness would make it a good decision to shred the deck and go back to the certainty of [home.]({@Day4-4})

{{Day4-4: Dark, Sprite, none}}

Home here isn't really a home yet. I'm out of place in this neighborhood. My earbuds broke today so I can't retreat into my music.

At least I'm here now, I can [open the front door]({#Day4Reveal1})

{{Day4MinPt1}}

[check my mailbox]({#Day4Reveal2})

{{Day4MinPt2}}

[climb the stairs]({@Day4-5})

{{Day4-5: Dark, Sprite, none}}

{#Day4FaintMusic}

...and hear a song I've never heard before.

[Who's playing that?]({@Day4-6})

{{Day4-6: Dark, Sprite, none}}

{#Day4Music1}

It's from inside my apartment.

[Go in.]({@Day4-7})

{{Day4-7: Dark, Sprite, gay-jesus, Scale, 0.5}}

{#Day4OpenDoor}

Oh my God, it's him!

What do I [say?]({@Day4-8})

{{Day4-8: Dark, Sprite, gay-jesus, Scale, 0.5}}

{#Day4SoundsGood}

I could have said "That sound was the most beautiful thing I heard today."

I could have said "Fuck you."

I could have [said...]({@Day4-9})

{{Day4-9: Dark, Sprite, roof, Scale, 0.1}}

{#Day4PlayMonologue}
...what I said to myself when I went to the roof and went over that moment in my head.

But it's not my job to say all that to a stranger.
