It's been a while since I played other interactive fiction for inspiration. I've had [My Boyfriend Came Back from the War](http://www.teleportacia.org/war) on my list for [a while.]({@Day5-2})

{{Day5-2: Sprite, rabbit-hole, Scale, 0.75}}

This summer is [my chance]({$day5onlyChance:inline}) to finally live the life where I follow up on things that seemed too trivial to justify spending time on before. To fall down [rabbit holes]({@Day5-3}) like I always wish I could.

{{Day5-3}}

So if you're wondering where I've gone in the next 24 hours, know that it started with a google search and the permission to keep clicking ["Open Link in New Tab."](http://awp.diaart.org/lialina/diaintro.html)
