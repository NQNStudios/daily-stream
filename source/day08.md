Interesting [conversation with]({$Day8MonologueFrom:inline}) our friend Bible Boy this morning in the kitchen.

[It went like this.]({@Day8M1})

{{Day8M1: Sprite, shirt-soak}}

First of all I noticed that his shirt was visibly wet in several different places which I couldn't explain because it hadn't been raining the night before. I don't ask Bible Boy questions so we'll never know why.

He had a big metal basket on wheels stuffed with crumpled up clothes: "Oh good morning Nat! I have to do laundry."

[*"Oh. Cool."*]({@Day8M2})

{{Day8M2: Sprite, shirt-soak}}

"Do you have to do your laundry?"

*(Is he trying to get me to do laundry together??)*

[*"No, I did mine a few days ago."*]({@Day8M3})

{{Day8M3: Sprite, shirt-soak}}

"There's this good laundromat down the block. I mean it's a little bit further than the other ones but I like it."

*(Someone's in the bathroom and I need to pee so I can't just peace out. Fuck)*

[*"Ok."*]({@Day8M4})

{{Day8M4: Sprite, shirt-soak}}

"Do you know about detoxing?"

*(Please don't explain this to me.)*

[*"Yeah."*]({@Day8M5})

{{Day8M5: Sprite, shirt-soak}}

"It's basically when you try to cleanse your environment and the things you put in your body of things that are toxic to you."

*(Oh really??)*

"I'm not as diligent about it as I should be but I do use this non-toxic laundry detergent. And I filter my water."

[*"Great."*]({@Day8M6})

{{Day8M6: Sprite, shirt-soak}}

"When I use toxic laundry detergent I notice I actually feel sick. That Tide stuff is so bad for you. I don't know if you feel ill, but I do."

[*"Uh-huh."*]({@Day8M7})

{{Day8M7: Sprite, shirt-soak}}

"And do you know about detoxing your liver? I won't explain it but just look it up, okay?"

*(Please leave.)*

"Sorry loading all that on you I just really like encouraging people to do these good things!"

*(The bathroom's open!)*

[*"Have a nice day, bye"*]({@Menu})
