{{5/29/18: S2, Sprite, outline, Scale, 0.1}}

Season 2 has been so linear so far. Maybe it's because the episodes really look like [this]({@Day6SourceCode}). Today I'm really gonna put things to the [test.]({@Day6Test})

{{Day6SourceCode: Sprite, sourcecode, Scale, 0.4}}

I'm making the game in a new engine called [Fractive](http://fractive.io). Both Fractive and [Stream of Pretentiousness](http://github.com/NQNStudios/daily-stream) are fully open source, in case you were wondering!

Fractive really needs an editor. Last year the episode structures were more free-flowing because internally they looked more like [this]({@Day6Twine}).

{{Day6Twine: Sprite, twine, Scale, 0.5}}

You can see how there's a little more room for creativity, structure-wise.

[Anyway,]({@5/29/18})

{{Day6Test: Sprite, rc1, Scale, 0.1}}

I'm having a pretty rough morning. I was the first person to get to RC, and I had a lot on my mind.

* [Last night]({@Day6LastNight})
* [Arrested Development]({@Day6ArrestedDevelopment})
* [Breakfast]({@Day6Breakfast})
* [Goddamn, do I need coffee]({@Day6Coffee})
* [It's so quiet]({@Day6Quiet})

{{Day6LastNight}}

{id:muteThis}I didn't get such good sleep last night. There were some kind of alarm going off down the street and it seemed like half an hour with sirens rushing past outside the window.{/id:muteThis}

Last week I bought [noise canceling headphones]({#Day6PutOnHeadphones}) to help with this kind of situation. 

{{Day6HeadphonesOn}}

They couldn't drown out everything. And I think it was a mistake trying to listen to a [podcast](https://www.acast.com/whitingwongs/) instead of music&mdash;podcasts keep my brain running instead of calming it down&mdash;but it was the season finale and I got excited...

Then I had weird dreams and woke up at 6:30. [I'm fucking exhausted.]({@Day6Exhausted})

{{Day6Exhausted}}

Maybe it's just that I'm past the Honeymoon stage, but maybe New York isn't my city after all.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Test})

{{Day6Breakfast: Sprite, rc1, Scale, 0.1}}

Just [10 bagels in]({@Day6Bagels}) and I'm already getting sick of them, but I don't have any other breakfast food in the fridge here.

I have most of a dozen eggs in the fridge at home, but I think I just have to [cut my losses]({@Day6Eggs}) there.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Test})

{{Day6Bagels: Sprite, philadelphia, Scale, 0.75}}

I haven't been able to find any cream cheese out here, and I've checked like half a dozen stores. It's not that their cream cheese is particularly good, but I have this weird no-reason brand loyalty to Philadelphia blueberry cream cheese. I've been eating my bagels with some communal jam in the RC fridge, but I really miss the real stuff. :'(

[Anyway,]({@Day6Breakfast})

{{Day6Eggs}}

I was gonna make myself eggs for breakfast every morning but the sink in the apartment piles up with other people's dishes. I've never had an apartment where that didn't happen. I almost never cook because of it. Really makes me miss living at home, my real home.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Breakfast})

{{Day6Coffee: Sprite, chemex, Scale, 0.2}}

The Chemex here is pretty awesome. I love the visceral feel of making coffee with it. Maybe I'll make a minigame all about that.

The problem is it takes [so damn long]({@Day6CoffeeTakesAWhile}).

[Orange juice]({@Day6OJ}) in the meantime?

[Anyway,]({@Day6Test})

{{Day6OJ}}

When I realized [cooking at my apartment was a bust,]({@Day6Eggs}) I still managed to salvage some of the groceries I'd bought. A jug of orange juice I stuffed in my backpack along with a pack of [paper plates]({@Day6PaperPlates}) I brought all the way on the subway to RC.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Coffee})

{{Day6PaperPlates}}

I got in an argument once about the environmental sustainability of using paper plates. I figured they were shitty for the environment, but my friend pointed out that we use a ton of water washing our reusable plates, too. I didn't bother to do any more research after that and I kind of feel bad about it, but I use paper plates now when I don't have the energy to wash dishes.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Coffee})

{{Day6CoffeeTakesAWhile}}

# The Morning Paradox

The worst thing in the world is the feeling of not yet having your morning coffee, and having to actually *make the coffee* while still in that state of [spiritual dysfunction.]({@Day6BadSugaring}) Also making breakfast.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Coffee})

{{Day6BadSugaring}}

Yesterday I messed up and put a packet of sugar directly in the pot. I was so furious with myself, even though I knew it was such a small mistake. I had to bring up a mantra I've been using to reign myself in, "The things you say to yourself, you wouldn't say to anyone else."

[Anyway,]({@Day6Coffee})

{{Day6ArrestedDevelopment}}

As I was laying awake at 6:30 in the morning I had a chance to watch the first episode of Season 5. It wasn't as bad as Season 4 but I'm still really worried that it'll suck.

Out here starving for connections to home and my comfortable past, I need this season to not suck. That show used to mean so much to me.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Test})

{{Day6Quiet: Sprite, rc2, Scale, 0.1}}

Here all alone, I can play my music through the speakers. I can actually sing along! It's been so long since I last sang. I can change into a skirt without anyone noticing.

I guess it's not so bad.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Test})

{{Day6Final: Sprite, outlineDone, Scale, 0.1}}

Okay this episode was a [whole lot of work]({@Day6Tomorrow}), but I nailed it. I mean, you be the judge and all, maybe it's boring as hell (probably) but the point is, I wanted to be nonlinear and I did it, and I stuck with it and wrote everything I put on the outline instead of quitting halfway.

Fractive still needs a proper editor, though.

{{Day6Tomorrow}}

Tomorrow I'll probably just dump some bullshit I've already written. :P

See you then,
&mdash;Nat
