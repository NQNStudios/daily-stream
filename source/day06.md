Season 2 has been so linear so far. Maybe it's because the episodes really look like [this]({@Day6SourceCode}). Today I'm really gonna put things to the [test.]({@Day6Test})

{{Day6SourceCode: Sprite, sourcecode, Scale, 0.4}}

I'm making the game in a new engine called [Fractive](http://fractive.io). Both Fractive and [Stream of Pretentiousness](http://github.com/NQNStudios/daily-stream) are fully open source, in case you were wondering!

Fractive really needs an editor. Last year the episode structures were more free-flowing because internally they looked more like [this]({@Day6Twine}).

You can see how there's a little more room for creativity, structure-wise.

I'm having a pretty rough morning. I was the first person to get to RC, and I had a lot on my mind.

* [Last night]({@Day6LastNight})
* [Breakfast]({@Day6Breakfast})
* [Goddamn, do I need coffee]({@Day6Coffee})
* [It's so quiet]({@Day6Quiet})

{{Day6LastNight}}

{id:muteThis}I didn't get such good sleep last night. There were some kind of alarm going off down the street and it seemed like half an hour with sirens rushing past outside the window.{/id:muteThis}

Last week I bought [noise canceling headphones]({#Day6PutOnHeadphones}) to help with this kind of situation.

They couldn't drown out everything. And I think it was a mistake trying to listen to a [podcast](https://www.acast.com/whitingwongs/) instead of music&mdash;podcasts keep my brain running instead of calming it down&mdash;but it was the season finale and I got excited...

Then I had weird dreams and woke up at 6:30. [I'm fucking exhausted.]({@Day6Exhausted})

Maybe it's just that I'm past the Honeymoon stage, but maybe New York isn't my city after all.

{{Day6Breakfast: Sprite, rc1, Scale, 0.1}}

Just [10 bagels in]({@Day6Bagels}) and I'm already getting sick of them, but I don't have any other breakfast food in the fridge here.

I have most of a dozen eggs in the fridge at home, but I think I just have to [cut my losses]({@Day6Eggs}) there.

[Anyway,]({@Day6Test})

{{Day6Bagels: Sprite, philadelphia, Scale, 0.75}}

I haven't been able to find any cream cheese out here, and I've checked like half a dozen stores. It's not that their cream cheese is particularly good, but I have this weird no-reason brand loyalty to Philadelphia blueberry cream cheese. I've been eating my bagels with some communal jam in the RC fridge, but I really miss the real stuff. :'(

[Anyway,]({@Day6Breakfast})

{{Day6Eggs}}

I was gonna make myself eggs for breakfast every morning but the sink in the apartment piles up with other people's dishes. I've never had an apartment where that didn't happen. I almost never cook because of it. Really makes me miss living at home, my real home.
