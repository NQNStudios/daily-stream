I'm back in New York City! This is the place where I first decided to start making Stream of Pretentiousness. Let me set the tone of the game by telling you an [anecdote]({@Day1-Anecdote}) about moving here.

{{Day1-Anecdote: Sprite, bunk, Scale, 0.3}}

I'm only here for the next 3 months, and on a tight budget. I live in a shared bedroom with a total of 6 beds. I'm top bunk on the left, and I don't get much [privacy]({@Day1-AloneTime}).

{{Day1-AloneTime: Sprite, no-fap-nat}}

Luckily I have an important group chat where I can [talk about]({@Day1-Talk}) what happens to my bodily functions without privacy.

Things were starting to get [out of hand]({@Day1-WhatToDo}). I sat down to write code on my first day at [The Recurse Center](http://recurse.com) and [all I could type was "sex,"]({#Day1ShowJoke}) forcing me to switch tracks and just learn Rust instead.

{{Day1-WhatToDo: Sprite, what-to-do}}

There's no such thing as a stupid question, so I usually tend to [just ask]({@Day1-WhatIDid}).

{{Day1-WhatIDid: Sprite, what-i-did}}

I took that shower. My mind's been a lot clearer.

{{Day1-Joke}}

That was a joke. This isn't *strictly* interactive *non*-fiction.
